Removed /wp-content/themes/hds/js/default.min.js from JS files to exclude from minification.  Not sure why I had this there, but if things stop working put it back. :)
Ditto with /wp-content/themes/hds-child/style.css 
* UNCHECKED COMBINE JS.  GETTING WEIRD ISSUES WITH IE (BRANDLOGO UNDEFINED) AS REPORTED FROM JEFF MORRELL AND ALAN FENN.  ALSO VIDEO DOESN'T WORK
* UNCHECKED OPTIMIZE CSS DELIVERY - DOESN'T WORK IN EDGE  (the moving title on sub-pages doesn't work)
* BASICALLY DON'T CHECK MORE THAN THE TOP 4 ITEMS

OTHER NOTES:

Every time that WordPress is upgraded, you will need to update the labels to say eName and ePassword at line 474 of /wp-includes/general-template.php
You cannot check the box to lazyload iframes and videos, as this will necessitate users pressing the back button twice when navigating between halls/explore page
For banner photos on individual pages, upload files that are 2500x600.  2500 sounds quite large, and it is, but if you use 1920x600, the resulting image will be too tall
